# Members Only Project

This project constists on a simple Rails app with basic authentication using Rails' built-in has_secure_password feature, that allows users to create posts.

Anyone can see the posts but only users with an account can create posts and see the author of each post.

A live version of the project can be seen [here](https://members-only-elshaka.herokuapp.com)
